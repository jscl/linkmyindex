Transcribe the following PDF index into a JSON list of objects.
Each block in the index starts with a topic (headline).
If no topic is found directly above the entry, use the topic from the previous entry, usually it is also repeated in the headline of the page directly beneath the page number.
Each entry typically has:
1. Sub-headline / Location (ending with ;) remove the ;
2. Author (ending with ;) remove the ;
3. Date (ending with ;) remove the ;
4. Page number (p.NN.), remove the p.

JSON object fields: "topic", "subhead", "author", "date", "page", "index_page".
The "index_page" is the page number where the entry is found in the index, usually found in the headline of the page.
Output ONLY THE RAW JSON LIST.
